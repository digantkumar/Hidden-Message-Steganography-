The idea of “hiding” a message inside a larger data object (text file, image etc.) is known assteganography.  Write a Python functionextract(text)that takes a passage of 
English-language text as a string and that recovers (and returns) the hidden message by takingthe first letter of every fifth word of the text.For  example,  when  applied
to  the  passage  shown  below  the  function  should  return  thestring “attack”.Yesterday  I  saw  an  aardvark  while  walking  my  pet  tortoise,  Frank.   
Whata  sight  this  was!   Aarvarks  are  nocturnal  animals  appearing  in  daylight  withcaution.  Make sure to bring kippers when you visit.
